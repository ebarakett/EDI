		3D Car Reflection

		This is a reflection my process making a 3D model of a toy car. Enjoy!

	<h3>
		Guidelines:
	</h3>
		<ul>
		<p>
			<li>The car's design will be comprised of the intersection of 3 different forms</li>
			<li>The car will be designed in a 1:1 ration 2</li>
				<ul> <li>The creator will aim for size accuracy within 1% of the car's actual size </li></ul>
			<li>The car's design file will be exported as STL</li>
			<li>The model will be uploaded and oriented in Cura for printing</li>
				<ul> <li>Support material should be minimized</li></ul>
			<li>The file should be saved as a gcode</li>
			<li>The final design is well documented, and the design process is reflected on</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

	<h3>
		Process:
	</h3>
		<ul>
		<p>
			<li>Creating the Engineering Drawing</li>
				<ul> <li>The car was drawn to scale using calipers</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>After the drawing was finalized, it was scanned</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>Screenshots were taken for each side of the car drawn</li></ul>
			<li>3D Modeling the car</li>
				<ul> <li>Each face of the car was composed on every plane side</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>Negative space was removed using the extrusion tool</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>Detailing was added using the extrusion and fillet tools</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>The file was exported as STL file</li></ul>
			<li>Printing the model</li>
				<ul> <li>The design was uploaded in Cura</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>Final adjustments were made and support material was minimized</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>The nozzle was set to 0.6mm</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>The file was exported as a GCODE</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>The model was printed</li></ul>
			<li>Documenting the process</li>
				<ul> <li>A CAD drawing was made off of the 3D model and used to calculate the margin of error</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>The design was imported into Modelo</li></ul>
				<ul> <li>This reflection was created as an HTML document</li></ul>
		</ul>
		</p>

	<h3>
		Setbacks and Solutions:
	</h3>
		<ul>
		<p>
			<li>One setback was scaling the drawing incorrectly</li>
				<ul> <li>Solution: the 3D model was resized to fit the dimensions of the smallest scaled face</li></ul>
			<li>Another setback was doing the project from home and not having the example models to get inspiration from</li>
				<ul> <li>Solution: I had to depend fully on the photos I had taken of the toy car prior to leaving</li></ul>
		</ul>
